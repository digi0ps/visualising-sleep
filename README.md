# Visualising sleep patterns of university students.

Project for CSE2006 - Data Visualisation course during 3rd semester.

The goal of this project was to collect data regarding sleep from a group of university students for a period of 3 months which was then prepocessed, visualised and analysed.

### Data factors considered:
- _Age_
- _Hours of sleep_
- _Food eaten the previous night_
- _How good was the sleep (rated on a scale of 5)_
- _How good they were feeling the morning after (rated on a scale of 5)_

### Worked on:
- Processed and cleaned raw data to be with used with d3.
- Visualised data factors using bar/line/steam charts in d3.
- Categorized students using K-means clustering algorithm.
